# Code Kata

This repo will contain various code kata challenges.

# Folder Structure

For now, I propose people maintain their own folders containing their username and kata name. Eventually it might be handy to further namespace with the current week of the year but for now keep it simple.

Example kata path:

```
Kata/nii236/larrys_array/
```
