# Fenders Perth Community Kata

## What is a kata?

Code Kata is an attempt to bring this element of practice to software development. A kata is an exercise in karate where you repeat a form many, many times, making little improvements in each. The intent behind code kata is similar. Each is a short exercise (perhaps 30 minutes to an hour long). Some involve programming, and can be coded in many different ways. Some are open ended, and involve thinking about the issues behind programming. These are unlikely to have a single correct answer. I add a new kata every week or so. Invest some time in your craft and try them.

**Remember that the point of the kata is not arriving at a correct answer. The point is the stuff you learn along the way. The goal is the practice, not the solution.**

## How to get started

Make sure you're a part of the Fenders Perth organisation on GitHub, this should probably mean you're already a part of our Slack group, but just in case, [here's the link to do that](http://fendersslack.herokuapp.com/).

Start by forking this kata repository and picking an exercise to start on, you don't have to start with the latest, have a look through them and pick one that interests you. Remember, it's not about arriving at the correct answer, it's all about learning along the way.

```
git clone git@github.com:username/kata.git
cd kata
git branch username-exercisenumber
mkdir -p username/exercisenumber
cd username/exercisenumber
```

Write your code, commiting as you go. Include a README in the directory if you feel like you need to explain how to run your exercises, or explain how it works. It's entirely up to you. Then push your branch to the repository and open a pull request for people to review, ask questions etc, before the branch is merged.

```
git push -u origin username-exercisenumber
```
